6e. Continuing from exercise 6d, let’s say the discount is only available
if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;

+ Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must
meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.

+ Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use
brackets () to control which code gets done first.

+ Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages.
